    Our team of collaborators brainstormed features and ideas using the I Like, I Wish, What If mind mapping tool. We found that users like to have creative freedom, wish there was an auto measuring tool, and wondering what it would be like if you can magically move furniture around. As a result from our ideation phase, we placed the most ideal features in each box based on the level of complexity and priority. 
    
    Therefore, the three key features we chose were mapping out a room/space, using your camera to take photo of objects, and being able to rearrange a room using AR.
    
    The journey map showcases Tommy’s ideal user path when using the RoomStyler App. It defines what his intended emotions would be per step/process, what his thoughts are as he is exploring the app, and identifies the roles of what the app is accountable for.
    The user flow sets the happy path of the user’s intentions when utilizing the app. It takes user through the steps on when signing up for an account, to scanning objects/rooms, and saving photos of scanned items to their library for later use.
    </span><span class="v38_187">User testing was an iterative process that was carried out at each project milestone to help narrow and simplify the tasks for the user. Prototypes were iterated and retested after gathering feedback from our guerilla user testings.
    
    We wanted to design a clean, easy-to-follow user interface for the brand that communicated reliability and accuracy of the user’s space.</span><span class="v38_195">Our team conducted guerrilla usability testings on our app.
    
    This resulted with the users being able to fulfill the tasks given to them at hand. There wasn’t any issues with the navigation or knowing where to go to find the information they needed to do the task. 
    
    The coach screens seemed to be very helpful for users who never used augmented reality before as well.
    
    There were maybe just minor iterations we made (user flow, renaming options) after the testings which resulted with positive feedback.</span><div class="name"></div><span class="v38_203">Takeaways</span><div class="name"></div><span class="v38_207">Adding a Social tab to share designs. 
    Incorporating User Ratings for designs shared.
    Having a Shop to Buy/Sell designs or items. 
    Get shop suggestions based on your designs.
    Create Hi-Fi Wireframe involving a style guide and color palette</span><div class="name"></div><span class="v34_116">Our team conducted a researched that consisted of 6 one-on-one interviews, 2 stakeholder interviews, and 7 completed surveys.
    
    During our interview phase, we discovered that creative people need easier ways of rearranging a space, therefore we believe that creating an app that utilizes the measure tool on IOS and Quick Measure on Android.
    
    This  lets the user freely decorate their space before doing any heavy lifting. Doing this will allow our users to save time and energy before rearranging or moving into a space.</span><div class="v34_118"></div><div class="v42_505"></div><div class="v42_506"></div><div class="v42_507"></div><div class="v42_508"></div></div></body></html> <br/><br/> <style>
